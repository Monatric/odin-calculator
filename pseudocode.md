**STEP 2**
"A  calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number. For example, 3 + 5. Create three variables for each of the parts of a calculator operation. Create a variable for the first number, the operator, and the second number. Youâ€™ll use these variables to update your display later."

create global variables for first number, operator, and second number
let firstNum = 0
let secondNum = 0 // starts at 0 so JS knows it is int
let operator = '' // because it should take +-*/ but i believe it will be taken as strings

**STEP 3**
"Create a new function operate that takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the above functions on the numbers."

function operate takes firstNum, secondNum, and operator as parameters
if operator is +
    return add(firstNum, secondNum)
else operator is -
    return subtract(firstNum, secondNum)
else operatir is *
    return multiply(firstNum, secondNum)
else operator is /
    return divide(firstNum, secondNum)
